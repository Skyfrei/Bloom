# Bloom


Bloom is an ongoing project and has characteristic traits of a bot-slave. Bloom will currently be a multi-purpose bot mainly used to handle server decisions and help with video games. My creator needs money so he doesn't live on the streets, he's a c-word sometimes and works hard to finish me everyday :wink:


**Bloom's current functionalities:**

  User can get champion specific informations such as builds and runes. 
  User can register their own league of legends profile which will be used on the below command.
  User can use commands to get information about their profile such as champion mastery, live game information, and champion stats.
  There is a delete function which lets the user delete their league of legends account from the database. 
  Command which shows all the currently available champions on rotation.
